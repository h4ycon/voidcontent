            <p class="lead">
              Okay, let's try and continue learning more about quantum
              mechanics.
            </p>

            <h4>So what is quantum mechanics really?</h4>
            <p>
              Today we are going to be touching upon some of the principles that
              dictate how these subatomic particles interact. We are going to
              look at the wave particle duality principle.
            </p>

            <p>
              To begin understanding the wave particle duality, we can start
              with looking at photons. To begin understanding such a concept at
              a high theoretical level, we need to lay down some foundational
              pillars of understanding. To set the scene we are going to jump
              around a bit in time. For beginners, let’s jump to the
              18-hundreds.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 1801 Thomas Young set up an experiment where he decided to
              study photons. Wait, wait wait, first we need to look into both
              Max Planck, Albert Einstein and maybe also Gilbert Lewis. If we
              want to be really nitpicky we might also set the scene by going
              into Isaac Newton and top it all off by looking at it from a
              philosophical framework.
            </p>

            <p>
              From the theory of Max Planck, Albert Einstein worked on the
              principle of photons, which later became attributed to Gilbert
              Lewis because of his creation of the word from the term, “smallest
              unit of radiant energy”. In other words, the particles we observe
              from light have a certain amount of energy, a photon.
            </p>

            <p>
              These giants again built their work upon the genius himself,
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton"
                >Isaac Newton</a
              >, who studied light in the 1700 century. His early work was a
              theory where light consists of what he termed “corpuscles”, which
              is another word for what we today refer to as particles. These
              corpuscles move in a line with a finite velocity and have kinetic
              energy, or as they said back in the days, impetus.
            </p>

            <p>
              This corpuscular theory of light was later worked upon by another
              great mind,
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes"
                >René Descartes</a
              >, before being continued by
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens"
                >Chrisitian Huygens</a
              >.
            </p>

            <p>
              When we think back at these times, the general zeitgeist, or the
              way thinkers thought about matter, were mostly philosophical and
              were “Aristotian” in principle. At the time, they changed their
              ways of thinking to a more clock-like workings understanding of
              the universe, where matter and motion dictated the way we
              understood the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we think about these concepts it’s great to have in mind the
              way these scientists thought about concepts. And how and why they
              thought upon their theories is again decided by their general
              understanding of the theories that plagued their lifetime.
            </p>
            <p>
              These thinkers sought the likes of Democritus (from the theory of
              the atom), and more generally Epicureanism which is a
              philosophical system that bases its system on atomists and
              materialism.
            </p>
            <p>Anyways, I digress. Back to the wave-particle duality.</p>

            <p>
              As every great discovery we usually start with an hypothesis, and
              in this case Louis de Broglie was the first who published a paper
              on the case of the dispute between the nature of light in his
              paper On the Theory of Quanta. He based his theory of the minds of
              the earlier mentioned physicists Planck and Einstein, where light
              has mass. From Einsteins Special Relativity theory(1905)
            </p>

            <p>
              The first form of this experiment were first done by the minds of
              Davisson and Germer. They set up an experiment now known as the
              Davisson-Germer experiment.

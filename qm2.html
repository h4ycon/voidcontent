              Quantum mechanics.<span class="text-muted"> Part 1</span>
            </h2>

            <p class="lead">
              The standard modell describes which particles exist at fundamental
              levels, and learning about them is a truly enriching experience.
            </p>

            <h4>So what is quantum mechanics really?</h4>
            <p>
              To put it simply, quantum mechanics is basically just the physics
              of small particles. And when we write about particles, we often
              mean the fundamental building blocks that make up reality.
            </p>

            <p>
              Anyways, to understand the building blocks that make up our
              universe we first need to look at what particles are made up of.
              To understand such concepts we can start with an atom. The atom
              was originally thought of to be the smallest “thing” an object is
              made of. So, if we try to look deeper into an object we can see
              that it is built up off of smaller building parts until we
              eventually reach what the Greeks called an atom, something
              uncuttable or indivisible.
            </p>

            <p>
              When scientists invented the microscope a whole new realm of
              reality opened itself up. We saw for the first time that what we
              perceive with the naked eye is not the entirety of the story we
              tell ourselves. We later on learned that molecules, a collection
              of atoms together, exists and we for the first time in modern ages
              started exploring the real human physical limits of what we can
              observe with all the tools and technology at our disposal.
            </p>

            <p>
              To explain further, when we discovered molecules, and started
              inspecting them we saw that they consisted of smaller building
              blocks as well. If we follow the old philosophers thought process
              of breaking down something into its smallest possible form, then a
              question arises, what is the smallest possible thing that exists?
              This is the atom, according to the old philosophers. Unfortunately
              the scientists jumped on the horses a bit too early and called
              what they discovered in 1827 the atom. Later on, we discovered
              that we are able to split up even atoms into smaller pieces.
            </p>

            <p>
              A whole subcategory of physics opened up, and scientists were busy
              for years exploring and creating new theories in this whole new
              world of particles.
            </p>

            <p>
              As you probably know of these things I’m going to cut a long story
              short and jump into the more fun parts, such as those in the realm
              of Quantum Physics. You see, when we started picking the atom
              itself apart, we found that it consists of an electron, a neutron
              and a proton. The combination of these three particles tells one
              story, but when we go deeper, and see what _these_ particles are
              made up of again, we paint a new picture.
            </p>

            <p>
              For starters, we found that the proton exists because of what they
              first thought were quarks. Quarks were originally just the name of
              a smaller building block that consists of even smaller building
              blocks. These are not yet proven, but our leading theory is that
              these quarks are made up of what we term, strings. Behold, string
              theory.
            </p>

            <p>
              String theory is a topic for another day, so let's jump back into
              the quantum realm. When particles arrange, they do so by the laws
              of nature. Peculiarly enough, these laws of nature are often
              described by nature itself, and seemingly just wait to be
              discovered. For instance, the four fundamental forces express
              themselves throughout the universe and dictate how matter
              interacts with each other. And that is not to mention the forces
              we haven't discovered yet.
            </p>

            <p>I’m looking at you black matter</p>

            <img
              class="postImages"
              src="images/blackhole.jpg"
              alt="image of a black hole"

            <br />

            <p>
              To briefly go through the four fundamental forces we can first
              start by looking at what we call gravity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Gravity is the force that pulls us down onto earth. Each and every
              object has a gravitational force. The force attracts two objects
              towards each other. Both ways.
            </p>

            <p>
              Simply put, the force or pull an object feels towards another
              object depends on the mass. The gravitational force doesn't paint
              the entire picture though, as there are other forces that interact
              with us. The other three fundamental forces are, the
              electromagnetic force, and the weak and strong nuclear force.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are going to be taking a closer look at electromagnetic force
              in another post, so for now, let's quickly describe the weak and
              strong nuclear force before moving on.
            </p>

            <p>
              The weak nuclear force is the name of the forces between
              particles. So the pull or push each particle has between
              themselves. So for instance, the electron and proton are
              oppositely charged so they repel each other. While two electrons
              would attract each other as they have the same charge.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the other hand, the strong nuclear force describes how the
              forces between these particles behave. And to look further into
              that, we need to look at a concept we mentioned earlier, quarks.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unfortunately for us quarks are only 1 piece of the puzzle. When
              looking at a particle we can first place them into one of two
              categories, either a fermion, or a boson. Whether a particle is a
              boson or a fermion depends on their spin and the symmetry of the
              system. We are not going deeper than that today, so let's look at
              these fermions and bosons.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fermions on the one hand consist of quarks and leptons, while
              bosons are divided into gauge and scalar bosons.
            </p>

            <p>
              This diagram neatly summarizes the entire particle model which is
              more commonly known as the Standard Model.
            </p>

              Well, that was a lot of information. We are going to end it here
              for this post as the topic is way too deep to explore in one post.

              Keep in the loop for when I post the next update by signing up for
              my newsletter ?here? I plan to keep writing about quantum
              mechanics and other topics I find interesting.
